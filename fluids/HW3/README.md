Use Actuator Disk Theory to analyze and evaluate the performance of stationary fans of varying sizes required to provide 3 cubic meters per sec ventilation air for a dairy. Consider fans of 0.5m, 1 m, and 1.5 m diameter;
assume air density is 1.2 kg/m^3. Provide a table showing the fan brake power requirement (in hp), and the air speedsat the rotor plane and in the slipstream for each fan size.
Show hand calculations for the 1 m diameter case; the other cases may be done by hand or within a spreadsheet (or MatLAB or MathCAD worksheet).
DISCUSSION: What factors might influence the choice of fan size for this application?
