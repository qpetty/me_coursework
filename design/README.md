Stresses Due to Curved Beam Bending
==============

These scripts were created to calculate the stress of a curved beam subjected to a constant moment.

crosssecton.py
--------------

This script accepts the geometric information of the cross section. Each line represents a thin section cut from the cross section.  Each input will have a distance from the center of curvature to the thin section and the width of the section perpendicular to the radius of curvature.

Shape Scripts
--------------

Creates the input for crosssection.py for the respective shape.
